Plugin Activation

Once the Inventory plugin files are added to the site the Inventory plugin can be activated from the plugins page in WordPress.

When the plugin is activated:
* 2 admin pages are created within in the CMS:
** Inventory Settings (Under Settings Menu)
** Inventory

* 1 public page is created:
** Boat
You must go into this page and choose a standard template that contains an area for the_content.


Inventory Settings Page

The settings page contains 2 input fields in the general settings area:
API Key
Party ID 

The Inventory display will not work without these fields.

The settings page also contains checkboxes and radio buttons for the user to select localisation settings.


Inventory Page

This is the main plugin page that controls the addition and removal of the plugin from pages within the WordPress website.

Here you can:

* View a list of active inventory displays
** Page that inventory is displayed on
** Condition (New/Used/Both)
** List of Manufactures selected for each display
** Option to remove the inventory display from each page
* Add a new inventory display
** Select Page to display inventory on (Pulls a list of the pages in the site)
** Select Condition (New/Used/Both)
** Choose manufactures to display (Including option of selecting all/none)
** Submit button

A page has to be created in WordPress first before adding inventory with a theme that contains an area for the_content
